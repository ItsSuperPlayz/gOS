# gOS (Windows 10+)
## (c) NGM / ItsSuperPlayz - DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE!
## What is this?
gOS is a Windows 10/11 utility tool (made for fun). Sources are free to download and edit at will.

Currently only featuring scripts made by other scripters. New features are to be updated.
## How to use?
**ATTENTION**: Disable your antivirus before running gOS. Antiviruses falsely detect some essential files used by gOS as malwares and can prevent them from running, therefore making gOS unusable.

To start using gOS, run the following command in Command Prompt (not Powershell) (copy and paste):
```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItsSuperPlayz/gOS/main/launcher|cmd /q /k
```
